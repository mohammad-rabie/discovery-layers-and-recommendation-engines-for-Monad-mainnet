---

#### 2. Smart Recommendations (🔥 High Impact)

**What "Smart" Means:**
- Personalized (different for each user)
- Accurate (actually relevant)
- Evolving (improves with data)
- Explainable ("Recommended because...")

**Algorithm Options:**

**Option A: Collaborative Filtering**
```python
"Users who viewed X also viewed Y"

Pros:
+ Discovers unexpected connections
+ No need for item metadata
+ Proven effective

Cons:
- Needs user interaction data
- Cold start problem
- Computationally expensive

Best for: Established platform with user data
```

**Option B: Content-Based Filtering**
```python
"Because you liked X (DeFi), try Y (also DeFi)"

Pros:
+ Works with limited user data
+ Easy to explain
+ Fast to compute

Cons:
- Creates filter bubbles
- Needs good item metadata
- Limited discovery

Best for: New platform, clear categories
```

**Option C: Hybrid Approach** (Recommended)
```python
Combine both + add rules

Algorithm:
1. If user has history: Use collaborative filtering
2. If new user: Use content-based
3. Always include: Trending, new, popular
4. Add randomness: Serendipity factor (10%)

Result: Best of both worlds
```

**Implementation Roadmap:**

**Week 1: Data Collection**
```javascript
// Track these events
- Dapp views (which, when, how long)
- Clicks (which links, which buttons)
- Searches (what terms)
- Filters applied
- Favorites/bookmarks
```

**Week 2: Simple Recommendations**
```javascript
// Rule-based first
function getRecommendations(user, currentDapp) {
  // 1. Same category (60%)
  const similar = dapps.filter(d => 
    d.category === currentDapp.category && 
    d.id !== currentDapp.id
  ).slice(0, 3);
  
  // 2. Trending in ecosystem (30%)
  const trending = dapps
    .sort((a, b) => b.views24h - a.views24h)
    .slice(0, 2);
  
  // 3. Random discovery (10%)

```

**Commit Convention:**
```bash
# Format: type(scope): description

feat(frontend): add dapp card component
fix(api): resolve search query bug
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(ui): improve button hover effects
refactor(backend): optimize database queries
test(integration): add API endpoint tests

# Types:
# feat: New feature
# fix: Bug fix
# docs: Documentation
# style: Formatting, no code change
# refactor: Code change that neither fixes bug nor adds feature
# test: Adding tests
# chore: Maintenance

## ⚡ Critical Path Analysis

### Must-Complete Tasks (Blockers)

**Week 1 Blockers:**
```
1. Repository setup → Everything depends on this
2. Monad RPC connection → Needed for data
3. Database schema → Needed for API
4. Basic UI structure → Needed for features
```

**Week 2 Blockers:**
```
1. Dapp data collection → Needed for everything
2. API endpoints → Needed for frontend
3. Monad integration → Core requirement
4. Choose bonus features early → Time-intensive
```

**Week 3 Blockers:**
```
1. Bug fixes → Can't submit broken app
2. Documentation → Required for submission
3. Deployment → Must be accessible
4. Submission form → Must submit on time
```

### Parallel Work Tracks

**Track 1: Frontend (Continuous)**
```
Week 1: Setup + Basic UI
Week 2: Feature implementation
Week 3: Polish + Testing
```

**Track 2: Backend (Continuous)**
```
Week 1: Setup + API structure
Week 2: Monad integration + Features
Week 3: Optimization + Deployment
```

**Track 3: Design (Front-loaded)**
```
Week 1: All design work (80%)
Week 2: Design polish (15%)
Week 3: Final touches (5%)
```

**Track 4: Documentation (Back-loaded)**
```
Week 1: Initial docs (20%)
Week 2: Document as you build (20%)
Week 3: Complete documentation (60%)
```

## 📊 Time Allocation Strategy

### Team of 4 (Recommended)

**Total Available Hours:**
```
4 people × 15 days × 8 hours/day = 480 hours
Realistic productive hours: 480 × 0.7 = 336 hours
```

**Hour Distribution:**
```
Core Features (P0):        168 hours (50%)
Bonus Features (P1):       101 hours (30%)
Polish & Testing:           50 hours (15%)
Documentation:              17 hours (5%)
────────────────────────────────────
Total:                     336 hours
```

### Team of 3

**Total Available Hours:**
```
3 people × 15 days × 8 hours/day = 360 hours
Realistic productive hours: 360 × 0.7 = 252 hours
```

**Adjusted Strategy:**
- Focus on core + 1 major bonus
- Reduce scope slightly
- More efficient collaboration needed

### Team of 2 (Minimum)

**Total Available Hours:**
```
2 people × 15 days × 8 hours/day = 240 hours
Realistic productive hours: 240 × 0.7 = 168 hours
```

**Adjusted Strategy:**
- Core features only initially
- Choose 1 bonus feature you excel at
- May need to cut some nice-to-haves
- Documentation must be prioritized

### Security Implementation

#### Input Validation

```typescript
// middleware/validation.ts

import { body, param, query, validationResult } from 'express-validator';

export const validateDappQuery = [
  query('page').optional().isInt({ min: 1 }),
  query('limit').optional().isInt({ min: 1, max: 100 }),
  query('category').optional().isAlpha(),
  query('search').optional().isString().trim().escape(),
  query('sort').optional().isIn(['tvl', 'users', 'volume', 'new', 'name']),
  
  (req, res, next) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }
    next();
  }
];

export const validateDappId = [
  param('id').isInt({ min: 1 }),
  
  (req, res, next) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }
    next();
  }
];
```

#### Authentication Middleware

```typescript
// middleware/auth.ts

import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

export const authenticateToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];
  
  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No token provided' });
  }
  
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
  }
};

export const verifyWalletSignature = async (req, res, next) => {
  const { walletAddress, signature, message } = req.body;
  
  try {
    const recoveredAddress = ethers.utils.verifyMessage(message, signature);
    
    if (recoveredAddress.toLowerCase() !== walletAddress.toLowerCase()) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Invalid signature' });
    }
    
    req.verifiedAddress = recoveredAddress;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Signature verification failed' });
  }
};
```

#### Rate Limiting

```typescript
// middleware/rateLimit.ts

import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';
import RedisStore from 'rate-limit-redis';
import Redis from 'ioredis';

const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);

export const apiLimiter = rateLimit({
  store: new RedisStore({
    client: redis,
    prefix: 'rl:api:'
  }),
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests, please try again later',
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false
});

export const searchLimiter = rateLimit({
  store: new RedisStore({
    client: redis,
    prefix: 'rl:search:'
  }),
  windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  max: 30, // 30 searches per minute
  message: 'Too many search requests'
});

export const authLimiter = rateLimit({
  store: new RedisStore({
    client: redis,
    prefix: 'rl:auth:'
  }),
  windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
  max: 5, // 5 attempts per hour
  message: 'Too many authentication attempts'
});
```

#### CORS Configuration

```typescript
// server.ts

import cors from 'cors';

const corsOptions = {
  origin: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? ['https://yourdomain.com', 'https://www.yourdomain.com']
    : ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:5173'],
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  maxAge: 86400 // 24 hours
};

app.use(cors(corsOptions));
```

#### Content Security Policy

```typescript
// middleware/security.ts

import helmet from 'helmet';

export const securityHeaders = helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com'],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", 'https://fonts.googleapis.com'],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", 'data:', 'https:'],
      connectSrc: ["'self'", 'https://rpc.monad.xyz', 'https://api.yourdomain.com'],
      fontSrc: ["'self'", 'https://fonts.gstatic.com'],
      objectSrc: ["'none'"],
      mediaSrc: ["'self'"],
      frameSrc: ["'none'"]
    }
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
});
```

### Environment Variables Security

```bash
# .env.example

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/monad_discovery
DATABASE_SSL=true

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# API Keys (never commit actual keys)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this
MONAD_RPC_URL=https://rpc.monad.xyz
DEFILLAMA_API_KEY=optional-api-key

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=production

# Port
PORT=3001
```

**Security Best Practices:**
```bash
# Never commit .env file
echo ".env" >> .gitignore

# Use strong secrets
openssl rand -base64 32

# Rotate secrets regularly
# Use environment-specific secrets
# Never log sensitive data
```

```

#### Cache Implementation

```typescript
// services/cacheService.ts

import Redis from 'ioredis';

class CacheService {
  private redis: Redis;
  
  constructor() {
    this.redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);
  }
  
  // Cache dapp list (5 minutes)
  async cacheDappList(key: string, data: any, ttl = 300) {
    await this.redis.setex(key, ttl, JSON.stringify(data));
  }
  
  async getCachedDappList(key: string) {
    const cached = await this.redis.get(key);
    return cached ? JSON.parse(cached) : null;
  }
  
  // Cache dapp details (10 minutes)
  async cacheDappDetail(dappId: number, data: any) {
    const key = `dapp:${dappId}`;
    await this.redis.setex(key, 600, JSON.stringify(data));
  }
  
  async getCachedDappDetail(dappId: number) {
    const key = `dapp:${dappId}`;
    const cached = await this.redis.get(key);
    return cached ? JSON.parse(cached) : null;
  }
  
  // Cache recommendations (1 hour)
  async cacheRecommendations(userId: number, data: any) {
    const key = `recommendations:${userId}`;
    await this.redis.setex(key, 3600, JSON.stringify(data));
  }
  
  async getCachedRecommendations(userId: number) {
    const key = `recommendations:${userId}`;
    const cached = await this.redis.get(key);
    return cached ? JSON.parse(cached) : null;
  }
  
  // Invalidate cache
  async invalidateDapp(dappId: number) {
    await this.redis.del(`dapp:${dappId}`);
    // Also invalidate related list caches
    await this.redis.del('dapps:popular');
    await this.redis.del('dapps:trending');
  }
  
  async invalidateAllRecommendations() {
    const keys = await this.redis.keys('recommendations:*');
    if (keys.length > 0) {
      await this.redis.del(...keys);
    }
  }
}

export default new CacheService();
```

### Database Query Optimization

```sql
-- Indexes for performance

-- Dapp queries
CREATE INDEX idx_dapps_category ON dapps(category_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_dapps_tvl ON dapps(tvl DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_dapps_users ON dapps(user_count DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_dapps_active ON dapps(is_active) WHERE is_active = true;

-- Full-text search
CREATE INDEX idx_dapps_search ON dapps USING GIN(to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || description));

-- Interactions (for recommendations)
CREATE INDEX idx_interactions_user ON interactions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_interactions_dapp ON interactions(dapp_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_interactions_type ON interactions(interaction_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_interactions_created ON interactions(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_interactions_composite ON interactions(user_id, dapp_id, interaction_type);

-- Composite index for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_dapps_category_tvl ON dapps(category_id, tvl DESC);
```

### Frontend Performance

```typescript
// Lazy loading routes
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const HomePage = lazy(() => import('./pages/HomePage'));
const ExplorePage = lazy(() => import('./pages/ExplorePage'));
const DappDetailPage = lazy(() => import('./pages/DappDetailPage'));
const ImmersivePage = lazy(() => import('./pages/ImmersivePage'));

// Code splitting for 3D components
const Scene3D = lazy(() => import('./components/3d/Scene'));

// Image optimization
<img
  src={dapp.logo}
  alt={dapp.name}
  loading="lazy"
  srcSet={`${dapp.logo}?w=300 300w, ${dapp.logo}?w=600 600w`}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 300px"
/>

// Virtualization for long lists
import { FixedSizeList } from 'react-window';

<FixedSizeList
  height={600}
  itemCount={dapps.length}
  itemSize={200}
  width="100%"
>
  {({ index, style }) => (
    <div style={style}>
      <DappCard dapp={dapps[index]} />
    </div>
  )}
</FixedSizeList>
```

- SEO is critical
- Team experienced with Next

**Trade-offs:**
- More opinionated
- Slightly heavier
- Learning curve if new to Next

```bash
# Next.js setup
npx create-next-app@latest monad-discovery --typescript --tailwind --app
```

---

### Styling: Tailwind CSS

**Why Tailwind?**
- ✅ Utility-first, rapid development
- ✅ No CSS file switching
- ✅ Consistent design system
- ✅ Excellent documentation
- ✅ Great with React

**Configuration:**
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
export default {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        monad: {
          purple: '#8A3CFF',
          blue: '#3C8AFF',
          dark: '#1A1A2E',
          light: '#F8F9FA'
        }
      },
      animation: {
        'float': 'float 3s ease-in-out infinite',
        'glow': 'glow 2s ease-in-out infinite alternate'
      },
      keyframes: {
        float: {
          '0%, 100%': { transform: 'translateY(0)' },
          '50%': { transform: 'translateY(-10px)' }
        },
        glow: {
          '0%': { boxShadow: '0 0 5px #8A3CFF' },
          '100%': { boxShadow: '0 0 20px #8A3CFF' }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  plugins: []
};
```

### Animation: Framer Motion

**Why Framer Motion?**
- ✅ Declarative animations
- ✅ Great React integration
- ✅ Gesture support
- ✅ Layout animations
- ✅ SVG support

**Examples:**
```tsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

// Fade in animation
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
>
  <DappCard />
</motion.div>

// Hover effect
<motion.button
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}
>
  Connect Wallet
</motion.button>

// Staggered list
<motion.ul
  variants={{
    hidden: { opacity: 0 },
    show: {
      opacity: 1,
      transition: {
        staggerChildren: 0.1
      }
    }
  }}
  initial="hidden"
  animate="show"
>
  {dapps.map(dapp => (
    <motion.li key={dapp.id} variants={itemVariants}>
      <DappCard dapp={dapp} />
    </motion.li>
  ))}
</motion.ul>
```

---

### State Management: Zustand

**Why Zustand over Redux?**
- ✅ Much simpler API
- ✅ Less boilerplate
- ✅ Smaller bundle size
- ✅ No Provider wrapper needed
- ✅ Great TypeScript support

**Example Store:**
```typescript
// stores/dappStore.ts
import { create } from 'zustand';

interface DappStore {
  dapps: Dapp[];
  filters: FilterState;
  loading: boolean;
  setDapps: (dapps: Dapp[]) => void;
  setFilters: (filters: FilterState) => void;
  fetchDapps: () => Promise<void>;
}

export const useDappStore = create<DappStore>((set) => ({
  dapps: [],
  filters: {},
  loading: false,
  
  setDapps: (dapps) => set({ dapps }),
  
  setFilters: (filters) => set({ filters }),
  
  fetchDapps: async () => {
    set({ loading: true });
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/v1/dapps');
      const data = await response.json();
      set({ dapps: data.data, loading: false });
    } catch (error) {
      set({ loading: false });
    }
  }
}));

// Usage in component
function DappList() {
  const { dapps, loading, fetchDapps } = useDappStore();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchDapps();
  }, []);
  
  if (loading) return <Loading />;
  return <div>{dapps.map(d => <DappCard key={d.id} dapp={d} />)}</div>;
}
```

### Server State: React Query

**Why React Query?**
- ✅ Automatic caching
- ✅ Background refetching
- ✅ Optimistic updates
- ✅ Loading/error states
- ✅ DevTools

**Example:**
```typescript
import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

// Fetch dapps
function useDapps(filters: FilterState) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['dapps', filters],
    queryFn: () => fetchDapps(filters),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000 // 10 minutes
  });
}

// Add to favorites
function useFavoriteDapp() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: (dappId: number) => addFavorite(dappId),
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['favorites']);
    }
  });
}

// Usage
function DappList() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useDapps({ category: 'defi' });
  const favoriteMutation = useFavoriteDapp();
  
  if (isLoading) return <Skeleton />;
  if (error) return <Error message={error.message} />;
  
  return (
    <div>
      {data.dapps.map(dapp => (
        <DappCard
          key={dapp.id}
          dapp={dapp}
          onFavorite={() => favoriteMutation.mutate(dapp.id)}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { OrbitControls, Stars } from '@react-three/drei';

function Scene() {
  return (
    <Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 0, 50], fov: 75 }}>
      <color attach="background" args={['#1A1A2E']} />
      
      <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
      
      <Stars />
      
      <OrbitControls />
      
      {/* Your 3D content */}
      <DappNodes />
    </Canvas>
  );
}
```

**Useful @react-three/drei Helpers:**
```tsx
import {
  OrbitControls,      // Camera controls
  PerspectiveCamera,  // Camera
  Stars,              // Starfield
  Text,               // 3D text
  Html,               // 2D HTML in 3D
  useGLTF,           // Load 3D models
  Float,              // Floating animation
  MeshDistortMaterial, // Cool materials
