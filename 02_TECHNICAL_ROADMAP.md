## 📊 Time Allocation Strategy

### Team of 4 (Recommended)

**Total Available Hours:**
```
4 people × 15 days × 8 hours/day = 480 hours
Realistic productive hours: 480 × 0.7 = 336 hours
```

Realistic productive hours: 360 × 0.7 = 252 hours
```

**Adjusted Strategy:**
- Focus on core + 1 major bonus
- Reduce scope slightly
- More efficient collaboration needed

### Team of 2 (Minimum)

**Total Available Hours:**
```
2 people × 15 days × 8 hours/day = 240 hours
